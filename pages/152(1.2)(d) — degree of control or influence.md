- In this context, the control or influence `c` directly corresponds to the degree of membership in the set of exploitative relationships. Therefore, the membership function would be:
- $$\mu_{\text{control}}(c) = c$$
- In this function, `μ_control(c)` represents the membership function for the degree of control or influence `c`. As `c` increases from 0 to 1, the value of `μ_control(c)` increases from 0 to 1, indicating that a greater degree of control or influence contributes more to the likelihood of an exploitative relationship.
- This function directly maps the degree of control or influence to the degree of membership in the set of exploitative relationships. This means that a defendant with no control or influence ($$c = 0$$) would have a degree of membership of 0 (not at all exploitative), while a defendant with complete control or influence (c = 1) would have a degree of membership of 1 (completely exploitative), with degrees of control or influence in between mapping to degrees of membership between 0 and 1.
