- cc 78.1(4)'s heading doesn't correspond to the statute's text:
	- **Endangering safety of ship or fixed platform**
		- (2) Every one who
			- (a) commits an act of violence against a person on board a ship or fixed platform,
			- (b) destroys or causes damage to a ship or its cargo or to a fixed platform,
			- (c) destroys or causes serious damage to or interferes with the operation of any maritime navigational facility, or
			- (d) places or causes to be placed on board a ship or fixed platform anything that is likely to cause damage to the ship or its cargo or to the fixed platform,
		- where that act is likely to endanger the safe navigation of a ship or the safety of a fixed platform, is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for life.
	- **False communication**
		- (3) Every one who communicates information that endangers the safe navigation of a ship, knowing the information to be false, is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for life.
	- **==Threats causing death or injury==**
		- (4) Every one who threatens to commit an offence under paragraph (2)(a), (b) or (c) in order to compel a person to do or refrain from doing any act, where the threat is likely to endanger the safe navigation of a ship or the safety of a fixed platform, is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for life.
- The heading suggests the following text will outline an offence describing on offence where a person threatens another resulting in death or injury. But the text itself describes an offence where a person threatens another, for the purpose of making them do or refrain from doing something,
