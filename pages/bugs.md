- # 78.1(4)'s heading doesn't correspond to the statute's text
	- ## overview
		- The provision's heading suggests the following text will outline an offence describing on offence where a person threatens another resulting in death or injury. But the text itself describes an offence where a person threatens another, for the purpose of making them do or refrain from doing something, in a way that is likely to endanger a ship or fixed platform. These are very different from one another
