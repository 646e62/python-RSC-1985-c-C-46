- Assuming that a relationship is more likely to be exploitative the closer the young person is to the bottom end of the age spectrum (16) than the top (18), this factor may be represented as a [[membership function]]:
- $$\mu_{\text{age}}(x) = \frac{x - 16}{18 - 16}$$
- This function `μ_age(x)` represents the degree to which a given age `x` contributes to the likelihood of an exploitative relationship. As `x` increases from 16 to 18, the value of `μ_age(x)` increases from 0 to 1, indicating that a higher age contributes more to the likelihood of an exploitative relationship.
- Note: This function assumes that the age is within the range [16,18].
