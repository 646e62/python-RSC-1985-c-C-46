- Fuzzy logic is a form of many-valued logic that allows for degrees of truth rather than the typical true or false (1 or 0) binary logic. This logic was developed to model the uncertainty of natural human language, like the difference between "very tall" or "somewhat tall". It's particularly well-suited to handle situations where you want to model a gradual transition from one state to another, such as a transition from young to old.
- One of the key concepts in fuzzy logic is the " [[membership function]] ". A membership function is a curve that defines how each point in the input space is mapped to a membership value (or degree of membership) between 0 and 1. It quantifies the fuzziness of the system by defining degrees of membership to a fuzzy set, which can be interpreted as the degree of truth of a statement in the fuzzy logic system.
