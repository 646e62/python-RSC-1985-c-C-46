- # fuzzy logic representation
	- Assuming that a relationship is more likely to be exploitative the closer the young person is to the bottom end of the age spectrum, this factor may be represented as a [[membership function]]:
		- $$\mu_{\text{age\_diff}}(x) = \frac{x}{n}$$
	- In this case, `μ_age_diff(x)` is the membership function for the age difference `x`. It represents the degree to which a given age difference contributes to the likelihood of an exploitative relationship. The function `μ_age_diff(x) = x / 20` maps an age difference `x` (which ranges from 0 to 20) to a value between 0 and 1, with larger age differences contributing more to the likelihood of an exploitative relationship.
	- In this function, `μ_age_diff(x)` represents the membership function for the age difference `x`, and `n` represents the maximum age difference considered. As `x` increases, the value of `μ_age_diff(x)` increases, indicating that a greater age difference contributes more to the likelihood of an exploitative relationship.
