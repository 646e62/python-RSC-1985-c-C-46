- # fuzzy logic representation
	- Assuming that a relationship is more likely to be exploitative the closer the young person is to the bottom end of the age spectrum, this factor may be represented as a membership function:
		- $$\mu_{\text{age\_diff}}(x) = \frac{x}{n}$$
	- In the context of [[fuzzy logic]] , the Greek letter μ (mu) is commonly used to denote a membership function. A membership function is a curve that defines how each point in the input space is mapped to a membership value (or degree of membership) between 0 and 1.
	- The membership function is an important concept in fuzzy logic, as it allows us to represent uncertainty or vagueness in the system. It is used to quantify the linguistic qualifiers often used in fuzzy logic systems, such as "very", "somewhat", "more", or "less".
	- In this case, `μ_age_diff(x)` is the membership function for the age difference `x`. It represents the degree to which a given age difference contributes to the likelihood of an exploitative relationship. The function `μ_age_diff(x) = x / 20` maps an age difference `x` (which ranges from 0 to 20) to a value between 0 and 1, with larger age differences contributing more to the likelihood of an exploitative relationship.
	- In this function, `μ_age_diff(x)` represents the membership function for the age difference `x`, and `n` represents the maximum age difference considered. As `x` increases, the value of `μ_age_diff(x)` increases, indicating that a greater age difference contributes more to the likelihood of an exploitative relationship.
