- # fuzzy logic representation
	- Assuming that a relationship is more likely to be exploitative the closer the young person is to the bottom end of the age spectrum, this factor may be represented as a membership function:
		- $$\mu_{\text{age\_diff}}(x) = \frac{x}{n}$$
	- In this function, `μ_age_diff(x)` represents the membership function for the age difference `x`, and `n` represents the maximum age difference considered. As `x` increases, the value of `μ_age_diff(x)` increases, indicating that a greater age difference contributes more to the likelihood of an exploitative relationship.
