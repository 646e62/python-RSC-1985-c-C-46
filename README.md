Expert system for the Criminal Code of Canada in Python

I'm designing a program to interpret the Criminal Code of Canada. The program will translate statutes into Python functions that return true/false results when objects representing events are passed to them. The objects may be created manually or through an expert-system-style questionairre.

> Any legal decision has a factual and normative component.

Operating on this hypothesis, this project proposes to implement an expert legal system using predefined legislative and jurisprudential rules that interact with factual objects.

## Facts object
At their base, criminal offences are premised in a factual matrix that the state alleges took place. 

### Offence types

The [Criminal Code's offence categorization](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/) may not prove to be the best, but it serves as a starting point. 

## Expert systems

### Definitions

### Procedural functions

### Evidence

## Things to continue to look into

* Probability: can the expert system account for different probabilities and evaluate offences on that basis?
* Utility: what good will an expert system like this be able to do?
