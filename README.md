Expert system for the Criminal Code of Canada in Python

I'm designing a program to interpret the Criminal Code of Canada. The program will translate statutes into Python functions that return true/false results when objects representing events are passed to them. The objects may be created manually or through an expert-system-style questionairre.



## Allegation object
At their base, criminal offences are premised in a factual matrix that the state alleges took place. 

The [Criminal Code's offence categorization](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/) may not prove to be the best, but it serves as a starting point. 

### Offence types

* Public order
* Terrorism
* Firearm and weapon
* Justice and law administration
* Sexual, public morality, and disorderly conduct
* Privacy invasion
* Disorderly houses, gaming, and betting
* Person and reputation
* Conveyances
* Property rights
* Fraudulent transactions
* Property
* Currency
* Criminal proceeds
* Attempts, conspiracies, accessories

## Expert systems

### Definitions

### Procedural functions

### Evidence

## Things to continue to look into

* Probability: can the expert system account for different probabilities and evaluate offences on that basis?
* Utility: what good will an expert system like this be able to do?
