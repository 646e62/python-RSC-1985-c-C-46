Expert system for the Criminal Code of Canada in Python

I'm designing a program to interpret the Criminal Code of Canada. The program will translate statutes into Python functions that return true/false results when objects representing events are passed to them. The objects may be created manually or through an expert-system-style questionairre.



## Allegation object
At their base, criminal offences are premised in a factual matrix that the state alleges took place. 

## Things to continue to look into

* Probability: can the expert system account for different probabilities and evaluate offences on that basis?
* Utility: what good will an expert system like this be able to do?
